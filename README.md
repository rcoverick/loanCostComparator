# loanCostComparator
CLI tool for computing amortization and comparing loans

## Purpose
This project serves 2 purposes
- help with comparing total costs and breakeven points between loans 
- serve as a learning project for familiarizing myself with C++ concepts and C++ best practices

commits and phases of this repo are updated as I learn (eg starting out with simple CLI that does some calculations, then refactor for header file practices, then refactor to use industry standard build tools like make, then refactor to add unit tests, etc..). Since I'm not new to git, I'm not really going to focus on complicated branching or setting up build pipelines for this simple CLI tool. Maybe in the future if I need a sample project to use while learning about some specific CI/CD tools
